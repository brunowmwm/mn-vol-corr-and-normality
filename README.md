## About this project

The objective of this project was to get an initial contact with the GitHub platform, in a way of getting to learn simple functions such as creating a repository, cloning it to the computer and commiting its final version to it.

Aside from that, i wanted to create my own code for calculating the rolling mean of log returns, rolling realized volatility and rolling correlation between these two factors within a chosen stock. 

From this study, i'll get a little bit further inside of the subject of Derivative Analytics with Python.

## Some observations

This is my first published code, it might be a bit grumpy and innefective but any errors will be corrected in the future. This was the first step which is necessary for creating a portfolio to showcase in interviews or for self-study.

## Functionalities

This code will help you to:
- Visualize the rolling average of the log returns (252 d), rolling realized volatility (252 d) and the correlation between these two (252 d).
- Calculate the daily and annual returns and standard deviations of the log returns.
- Test the normality of the sample, skewness and kurtosis.

## Logbook:

### Day 1 - 2022/04/19

A: Today i decided to publish my own code, as so, i would have to learn simple functions of Git and GitHub.

B: As the functions were learned, i started to code a project using the Derivative Analytics with Python book by Yves Hilpisch as visual reference (saw the graphs and results and decided to code them by myself).

### Day 2 - 2022/04/20

A: I finished the code, but it looks pretty bad. I have to correct this.
B: I somewhat cleaned the code, did the LinkedIn post and the results PDF.
